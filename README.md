#Optimization Problem: The Sushi Restaurant Case

## 2nd Practical Project of the Logic Programming Curricular Unit

### Instructions for Running The Program

In order to run the program, the user must have SICstus Prolog development system installed in their machine, open its console, consult the file **sushi_new.pl** and type **start.** on the console.
After starting the program, a menu will appear with several options. The user can navigate using keyboard numerical input and choose which option to run. The menu has 3 default problems, one small, one medium and one big.
If the user wants to run other problem instances, there are some predicates available to do so.
These predicates are the following:
- Default Problems:
    - test_solve.
    - test_solve_medium.
    - test_solve_medium_big.
    - test_solve_very_big.
    - test_solve_big1.
    - test_solve_big2.
    - test_solve_big3.
    - test_solve_big4.
- Fixed Number Of Chefs Problems:
    - test_fixedChefs_10.
    - test_fixedChefs_15.
    - test_fixedChefs_20.
    - test_fixedChefs_25.
    - test_fixedChefs_30.
    - test_fixedChefs_40.
    - test_fixedChefs_45.
    - test_fixedChefs_50.
- Fixed Number Of Meals Problem:
    - test_fixedMeals_5.
    - test_fixedMeals_10.
    - test_fixedMeals_15.
    - test_fixedMeals_20.
    - test_fixedMeals_25.
    - test_fixedMeals_30.

Be careful, though, some of these problems take a lot of time to run!
